# Changelog

All notable changes to Dreamer. Format roughly follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); versions follow
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

Until the first tagged release, `main` is the live reference. After `v0.1.0`
tags, breaking changes bump the minor version (0.x.0), fixes bump patch.

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed — Bridge timed out connecting to daemon on Windows (IPv4/IPv6 mismatch)

Symptom: Unity Editor logged `[Dreamer] Background bridge error: The operation has timed out.` repeatedly. `./bin/dreamer status` reported the bridge as disconnected even though Unity was open and focused. Commands queued indefinitely with `waitingReason: "unity_disconnected"`. `netstat -an | findstr <port>` showed `0.0.0.0:<port> LISTENING` plus several `[::1]:NNNN -> [::1]:<port> SYN_SENT` lines that never advanced.

Root cause: the daemon called `server.listen(port, '0.0.0.0', …)` — IPv4 only — while the Unity bridge built its base URL as `http://localhost:{port}`. On Windows, `localhost` resolves to `[::1]` (IPv6) first for many configurations. The bridge's heartbeat opened an IPv6 socket that hung in `SYN_SENT` until UnityWebRequest's timeout elapsed.

Two complementary fixes (belt-and-braces — either alone resolves it):

- **Daemon**: bind dual-stack — `server.listen(port, '::', …)` instead of `'0.0.0.0'`. Node accepts both stacks on `'::'`. `isLocalhost()` already whitelists `127.0.0.1`, `::1`, and `::ffff:127.0.0.1`, so the auth check is unchanged.
- **Bridge**: hardcode `BaseUrl = "http://127.0.0.1:{Port}"` instead of `localhost`. Removes the resolver dependency entirely so connections are deterministic across host configurations.

Reported by @AnttiJ73 from a downstream project (Endless Depths) — patches were applied locally there first; this brings them upstream so `./bin/dreamer update` picks them up.

### Changed — `dreamer search` now indexes per-kind topic keywords + a 4× larger synonym map

The synonym map grew from 17 word-groups (~50 entries) to ~70 word-groups (~250 entries) — covers create / delete / inspect / find / move / save / play / compile / wire / animate / atlas / ui / physics families with symmetric cross-links. New per-kind `KIND_KEYWORDS` map attaches topic tags directly to the right kinds so a query lands name-tier:

- `ppu` / `pixelsperunit` / `filtermode` / `isreadable` / `wrapmode` / `maxtexturesize` / `texturetype` → `set-import-property`
- `atlas` / `spritesheet` / `tileset` / `tile` / `cell` / `islands` / `subsprite` → `slice-sprite`
- `playmode` / `runtime` / `start_game` / `simulate` → `set-play-mode`
- `hud` / `canvas` / `menu` / `panel` / `gui` / `button` → `create-ui-tree`
- `controller` / `fsm` / `statemachine` → `create-animator-controller`
- `blendtree` / `mix` → `add-animator-blend-tree`
- `wire` / `connect` / `link` / `reference` / `assign` / `serialized` → `set-property`
- `verify_shader` / `pink` / `gpu_error` → `shader-status`
- `verify_compile` / `csharp` / `syntax` → `compile-status`
- … plus animation / mask / icon / build-scene / sorting-layer / cursor topic tags.

Verified end-to-end: `verify shader` → shader-status (was → validate-sprite); `find prefab` → find-assets (was → inspect-hierarchy); `playmode` / `run the game` / `exit playmode` → set-play-mode; `atlas slice` / `spritesheet` / `tile slicing` → slice-sprite; `tint material` → set-material-property; `extract prefab` → save-as-prefab; `kill object` / `destroy gameobject` → delete-gameobject; `fork asset` → duplicate. 8/8 prior-commit regression queries still pass — new keywords broaden coverage without disrupting precise hits.

Conservative on truly ambiguous tokens — `set`, `key`, `type`, `value`, `name`, `tree`, `asset`, `go` deliberately have no synonym entry to avoid flooding multi-token queries.

### Added — `dreamer-sprite` skill + skill discovery routes through `search`

- New auto-loading skill at `.claude/skills/dreamer-sprite/SKILL.md` covering the sprite-2d add-on (preview-sprite / slice-sprite / extend-sprite / validate-sprite / set-import-property). Documents the four authoring modes (`grid`, `auto`, `rects`, `merge`), the four-pass extend recovery (IoU → candidate template → coherent-motion → brute-force), the eight auto-validation checks with their `suggestedRect` / `suggestedName` / `suggestedFix` fields, and the `isReadable=true` prerequisite. Activates on mentions of sprite sheet, atlas, slicing, PPU, pixels per unit, filter mode, pivot, or composite sprite.
- `dreamer-sprite` and `dreamer-ugui` skills now ship as part of `./bin/dreamer addon install <name>` (mirrored to the project alongside the package), and are pulled by `./bin/dreamer update` whenever the corresponding add-on is installed. Add-on installs also stamp a CLAUDE.md section so future Claude sessions know the add-on exists without having to re-discover it.
- The core `dreamer` skill now leads with **`./bin/dreamer search "<free-text>"`** as the default discovery interface — replaces the old "list all kinds via `help`" guidance. `tasks.md` gains a top-row `search` entry and a full Sprite-sheet authoring section. `dreamer-ugui` skill links to `search` for verb lookup.
- Closes a documented LLM failure mode: search shipped a release ago but the skill files still told Claude to use `help`, so the new tool was effectively invisible to agents.

### Added — `dreamer search` (default discovery interface)

Schema-aware command discovery. Closes a real LLM failure mode: agents constructing names like `duplicate-asset`, `copy-prefab`, or `duplciate` (typo) would conclude the feature was missing when the actual verb is `duplicate`. Search across:

- Verb names (kebab-case CLI form, snake-case kind, hand-curated aliases)
- Schema summaries
- Arg names + descriptions
- Example CLI lines
- Pitfall text

Two-pass ranking: a precise pass with synonym + stem expansion (`copy↔duplicate`, `clone↔duplicate`, `remove↔delete`, `show↔inspect`, etc., plus `-s` / `-ed` / `-ing` stem stripping). If the precise pass returns fewer than 10 results, a broad pass kicks in with widened Levenshtein (≤3 vs ≤2), character-trigram similarity, and the zero-token-penalty disabled — "very loose" criteria so vague queries always surface ≥10 candidates when possible. Each result is tagged `pass: 'precise' | 'broad'` so the caller knows the confidence level.

- **`dreamer search <query>`** — top-level discovery (`dreamer search "copy prefab"`, `dreamer search ppu`, `dreamer search "set ppu"`).
- **`dreamer help <unknown>`** falls back to search instead of dumping the full kind list. `dreamer help duplicate-asset` now returns `duplicate` as top match with score + match reasons.
- **Daemon-side `Unknown command kind` errors** now include a `suggestions[]` field with the top 5 fuzzy matches — the bridge surfaces these directly to the caller.

Each result includes a `matchedOn[]` list so the LLM sees *why* something matched (`'copy'→'duplicate' name 'duplicate' exact`, `'prefab' summary word`, etc.) — match-reason transparency lets the LLM judge confidence without re-running.

### Added — Auto-validation on every sprite-sheet operation

Each sprite-sheet command now runs eight sanity checks against the post-operation state and attaches a `validation: { ok, summary, count, warnings[] }` field to the result. Surfaces issues an LLM would otherwise discover by trial-and-error round-tripping through preview-sprite.

- **error**: `out_of_bounds` (rect extends past texture), `duplicate_name` (ambiguous lookups).
- **warn**: `empty_rect` (zero opaque pixels — stale after art deletion), `partially_clipped` (boundary cuts through opaque content — sprite extends past rect), `orphan_pixels` (opaque-pixel islands ≥64 pixels not inside any rect — content forgot to slice).
- **info**: `overlap` (intentional for merge-bbox composites), `low_density` (<5% opaque), `tiny_rect` (<4px on a side).

For three kinds the validator pre-computes the fix so the LLM doesn't have to re-scan the pixels:
- `partially_clipped`: flood-fills from inside-edge content to find the sprite's true bbox → emits `suggestedRect` + plain-text "Widen to …".
- `low_density`: scans the rect for the opaque-pixel bbox → emits `suggestedRect` + "Tighten to …".
- `orphan_pixels`: detects the dominant `<prefix>_<N>` naming pattern from existing rects, picks the next index → emits `suggestedRect` + `suggestedName` + "Add rect … named …".

`validate-sprite --asset PATH` runs the same checks on demand for assets the agent didn't author. Auto-attached on `slice-sprite` / `extend-sprite` / `slice-sprite --mode merge` results.

Bug fix incidental: `ApplySpriteRects` no longer throws on duplicate-named existing rects (now keeps the first spriteID seen and lets validation report the duplicate).

### Added — `extend-sprite` (sprite-sheet edit-without-breaking-references)

Extends a sliced sheet without losing existing rect names or `spriteID`s — protects every prefab, animation, and Animator reference that depends on those names. Four-pass orphan recovery, applied in order of cost:

- **Pass A (IoU):** auto-detects islands in the current sheet, IoU-matches them against existing rects. Handles "artist added new sprites in unused whitespace" — original rects keep their names, ID, alignment; positions snap to the candidate island's exact bounds.
- **Pass B (candidate-restricted template match):** for unmatched existing rects, pixel-matches the cached pre-edit content against current islands of similar size (±10%). Handles single-sprite relocations.
- **Pass C (coherent-motion guess):** computes median (dx, dy) across all successful matches; for remaining orphans, tests `oldPos + medianDelta`. Catches sprites that don't fit the size band but moved with the rest of the sheet (e.g., merged-bbox composite rects that span multiple islands — the case where the previous candidate-restricted approach fell through).
- **Pass D (brute-force scan):** for any still-unmatched orphan, slides the template across all positions with sample-pixel early-exit (~150k positions on a 1024×600 sheet, sub-second). Tie-breaks by proximity to the median-delta hint to avoid arbitrary picks on repetitive content (tilesets).
- **Unmatched islands** appended as new rects with next-available index (`<prefix>_<N>`).
- **Still-unmatched existing rects** reported as orphans (kept in place — agent decides).

Auto-cache: every successful slice / extend operation now writes per-rect PNGs to `Library/Dreamer/SpriteSlices/<assetGuid>/` keyed by `spriteID`. Invisible to the user, gitignored. This is what Stage 2 template-matches against. Cache rebuilds on the next slice/extend after a Library wipe.

Verified end-to-end on the test fixture by simulating a 200-pixel canvas resize WITH a merged-bbox rect (PostSplitTest spanning two islands): 15 sprites realigned via candidate template, 1 (the merged composite) realigned via coherent-motion at score 1.00, 0 orphans. Names + spriteIDs preserved across the resize.

Remaining limitations documented in the schema: sprites whose pixel content was actually redrawn fall through to orphan even with brute-force, since no position in the new sheet matches the cached pixels.

### Added — Sprite-sheet workflow (preview / slice / import settings)

- **NEW ADDON `com.dreamer.agent-bridge.sprite-2d`** — sprite-sheet authoring lives in its own package (mirroring the `ugui` and `animation` addons), so 3D-only projects don't compile sprite code or pull in `com.unity.2d.sprite`. Install via `./bin/dreamer addon install sprite-2d`.
- **`preview-sprite --asset PATH [--sub-sprite NAME] [--save-to PATH]`** *(addon)* — render a sprite (or one named sub-sprite from a sliced sheet) to PNG. Default for Multiple-mode sheets: full texture with colored rect outlines per sub-sprite, plus a `sprites[]` array mapping color→name. Open the resulting PNG with the Read tool to inspect slicing visually.
- **`slice-sprite --asset PATH --mode grid|auto|rects|merge [...]`** *(addon)* — author the spritesheet rects.
  - `grid --cell WxH [--padding x,y] [--offset x,y]`: regular tile slicing, skips fully-transparent cells.
  - `auto --min-size N`: connected-component scan via Unity's `InternalSpriteUtility.GenerateAutomaticSpriteRectangles`.
  - `rects --rects '[{name,x,y,w,h,...}]'`: explicit JSON.
  - `merge --groups '[{keep, absorb:[name1,name2,...]}]'`: combine existing rects into a union-bbox (for composite islands — e.g. character + shadow that auto-slice split apart).
  Auto-flips `spriteImportMode` to Multiple, preserves `spriteID` for name matches across re-slices (keeps prefab/animation references intact).
- **`set-import-property --asset PATH --property NAME --value JSON`** *(core)* — generic AssetImporter property setter (TextureImporter / ModelImporter / AudioImporter / etc.). Reflects on the importer subclass and auto-reimports. Closes the gap that `set-property` only reaches the runtime asset, not its importer. Common uses: `spritePixelsPerUnit`, `filterMode "Point"`, `textureType "Sprite"`, `isReadable true` (required before `slice-sprite --mode auto`). Stays in core because audio/model importers benefit too.
- `dreamer addon list` / `addon install` now also lists `animation` and `sprite-2d` (animation was previously installable only via manual git-clone — fixed in passing).
- Missing-addon hint expanded: trying `preview-sprite` / `slice-sprite` without the addon now returns "Run: ./bin/dreamer addon install sprite-2d", same pattern the ugui kinds already had.

### Added — Queue control + GameObject layer assignment

- **`cancel <id>`** / **`cancel --state STATE`** / **`cancel --task TASKID`** — cancel queued/waiting/dispatched/running commands. Single-id form for one command; bulk form flushes everything matching the filter (e.g. `cancel --state waiting` clears all Play-Mode-parked commands without exiting Play Mode). Daemon-side cancellation API existed but had no CLI surface.
- **`set-layer (--scene-object PATH | --asset PATH [--child-path SUB]) --layer NAME_OR_INDEX [--recursive]`** — assigns `GameObject.layer`. Layer names auto-resolve via `LayerMask.NameToLayer`; numeric indices accepted 0–31. `--recursive` mirrors Unity's "set children too?" Inspector prompt. `set-property --property m_Layer` now intercepts with a directive error pointing here (m_Layer lives on the GameObject anchor, not a Component — same pattern as `rename` for m_Name).
- Schema validator now accepts union types (`type: ['string', 'number']`) so commands like `set-layer` can document both name and index forms.

### Added — Animation tooling Phase 2 (15 commands across 5 areas)
Comprehensive animator authoring beyond the Phase 1 surface (create + add states/parameters/transitions). Phase 2 adds iteration safety, multi-layer controllers, blend trees, avatar masks, and override controllers — verified end-to-end.

**Iteration ergonomics — modify mistakes without recreating the controller**:
- `remove-animator-parameter --name X [--force]` — refuses by default if any transition condition references the parameter; `--force` removes anyway and reports `orphanedConditions` count.
- `remove-animator-state --name X [--layer N]` — removes the state and scrubs dangling incoming transitions on the source side.
- `remove-animator-transition --from STATE --to STATE [--layer N] [--index N]` — by ordinal among matching pairs (multiple transitions between the same states are common for OR-semantics).
- `update-animator-state --name X [--layer N] [--rename NEW] [--motion CLIP] [--speed N] [--mirror T] [--cycle-offset N] [--write-defaults T]` — partial update, only listed fields change; reports `changedFields[]`.
- `update-animator-transition --from --to [--index N] [--has-exit-time T] [--exit-time N] [--duration N] [--offset N] [--can-self T] [--interruption-source SRC] [--conditions JSON]` — same partial-update model; conditions wholesale-replace when given.

**Layer management — multi-layer controllers (upper/lower body, additive overlays)**:
- `add-animator-layer --name X [--weight N] [--blending Override|Additive] [--mask AVATAR_MASK_PATH] [--ik-pass T]`
- `remove-animator-layer --layer N` — refuses on layer 0 (every controller needs a base layer).
- `set-animator-layer --layer N [--name X] [--weight N] [--blending B] [--mask P] [--ik-pass T] [--synced-layer N] [--sync-timing T]`

**Blend trees — the most-requested gap**:
- `add-animator-blend-tree --name STATE --type 1d|2d-simple|2d-freeform-directional|2d-freeform-cartesian|direct [--blend-parameter P] [--blend-parameter-y P] [--children JSON]` — creates a state whose Motion is a BlendTree, sub-asset of the controller. Children declared in one shot via JSON: 1D uses `threshold`, 2D uses `position [x,y]`, Direct uses `directBlendParameter`.

**Avatar masks — restrict layers to specific bones / humanoid parts**:
- `create-avatar-mask --name X [--path P] [--humanoid JSON] [--transforms JSON]` — humanoid JSON: `{"Body":true,"Head":true,"LeftLeg":false}` (Root, Body, Head, LeftLeg, RightLeg, LeftArm, RightArm, LeftFingers, RightFingers, LeftFootIK, RightFootIK, LeftHandIK, RightHandIK).
- `set-avatar-mask --asset PATH [--humanoid JSON] [--transforms JSON]` — humanoid is partial-update, transforms is total-replace.
- `inspect-avatar-mask --asset PATH` — full humanoid + transforms readout.

**Override controllers — variant characters reusing a base graph**:
- `create-animator-override-controller --name X --base BASE_CONTROLLER [--path P]`
- `set-animator-override-clip --asset OVR (--base-clip ORIG --override-clip NEW | --overrides JSON)` — single or batch.
- `inspect-animator-override-controller --asset OVR` — base + per-clip overrides with override-vs-passthrough state.

**Inspect enhancement**: `inspect-animator-controller` now surfaces every layer's `defaultWeight`, `blending`, `ikPass`, `syncedLayerIndex`, `avatarMaskPath`. States with a BlendTree motion include `motionType:"BlendTree"` + nested `blendTree` object (type, blendParameter, blendParameterY, childCount, full children list with motion paths, thresholds/positions, timeScale, mirror, cycleOffset).

End-to-end verified: 3 parameters → 3 states → transitions → remove parameter → rename state → update transition → add layer → add 1D blend tree → create avatar mask → assign mask to layer → create override controller → inspect → all consistent.

### Fixed — UX papercuts (4 bugs across daemon/bridge/ugui)
- **Button label silently dropped** in `create-ui-tree` — `{type:"Button", label:"Cancel"}` rendered as the literal text "Button". Asymmetry between widgets: `Button`'s tree builder only forwarded `text` (not `label`) to its widget op, while `Toggle` / `Slider` already used `label`. Fixed both `BuildButton` (UITreeOps.cs) and `CreateButton` (UIWidgetOps.cs) to accept either, preferring `label`. The widget set is now consistent.
- **`set-rect-transform --size '[300,60]'` rejected** by daemon schema validator with "must be string, got array". The C# side already supported all three forms (string `WxH`, array `[w,h]`, dict `{w,h}`); only the schema entry constrained it to `string`. Loosened to `any` for `size`, `pivot`, `offset`, `offsetMin`, `offsetMax`. CLI now also pre-parses bracketed strings as JSON before submitting, so the array form survives shell quoting.
- **Git-Bash leading-slash path translation now auto-corrected** instead of merely warned. `--parent /Foo` on Git-Bash gets rewritten by MSYS to `C:/Program Files/Git/Foo` before reaching the CLI; previously the CLI warned but still passed the broken path to Unity, producing a mysterious "not found". Now the CLI detects the translated form, strips the prefix back to `/Foo`, and prints a notice with the recovery action.
- **Scene-object "not found" errors include near-match suggestions.** Walks all loaded scenes' transforms scoring leaf names by (1) case-insensitive equal, (2) bidirectional substring contains, (3) bounded Levenshtein distance ≤ 2. Returns up to 5 candidate scene paths. `windoww` → "Did you mean: /MainMenu/Window?". `Toog` → "Did you mean: /MainMenu/Window/Tog?". Implementation in `SuggestNearMatches` + `LevenshteinAtMost` in PropertyOps.cs (used by every command that does scene-path resolution: rename, delete, set-property, add-component, etc.).

### Changed — Default screenshot folder moved to project root
- Screenshots now save to `DreamerScreenshots/` at project root instead of `Library/DreamerScreenshots/`. Library/ is hidden in VS Code Explorer (gitignored, often in `files.exclude`), making screenshots inconvenient to browse. The new folder is auto-created on first write with a self-ignoring `.gitignore` (`*` + `!.gitignore`) so PNGs stay out of source control while the folder remains visible. Existing `--save-to` overrides are unaffected.

### Changed — sharper screenshots, on-demand resolution presets
- **`screenshot-scene` default resolution is 1280×720** (HD). Earlier defaults of 1920×1080 / 2560×1440 produced larger files than necessary for typical layout reviews; HD keeps file sizes ~60 KB while remaining legible.
- **`--preset layout|normal|text`** for one-shot resolution selection without remembering pixel counts:
  - `layout` → 800×450 (quick composition check, smallest file)
  - `normal` → 1280×720 (same as default — explicit name)
  - `text` → 2560×1440 (text readability, dense detail)
  - Explicit `--width` / `--height` override the preset's value for that dimension; mix freely.
- **`--filter-mode point|bilinear|trilinear`** flag on `screenshot-scene`. **Default is now `point`** — sharper than Unity's authored filter modes (almost always Bilinear) and the right call for agent inspection. Every UI source texture (`Image`, `RawImage`, `SpriteRenderer`) has its `filterMode` temporarily overridden for the duration of the render, then restored. Pass `bilinear` / `trilinear` to override (rarely needed). Render targets also inherit this filter and MSAA is forced off (`antiAliasing=1`) so renders are pixel-accurate rather than supersampled.
- Result reports `filterMode` (the resolved mode) and `textureFiltersSwapped` (count of distinct source textures whose filter was overridden, deduped by atlas).

### Added — `screenshot-scene` + TextMeshPro support
- **`./bin/dreamer screenshot-scene [--camera NAME] [--width 1920] [--height 1080] [--background-color HEX] [--transparent] [--save-to PATH]`** — render any Camera in the active scene to a PNG. Defaults to `Camera.main`, falling back to the first Camera in the scene. Captures 3D, 2D sprites, particles, post-processing, and UI canvases.
- **ScreenSpaceOverlay canvases handled automatically** — they bypass cameras (drawing directly to the back buffer in a final compositing pass), so off-screen `cam.Render()` doesn't see them. `screenshot-scene` temporarily flips every active overlay canvas to `ScreenSpaceCamera` bound to the render camera, runs the layout pass, captures, then restores the original `renderMode` / `worldCamera` / `planeDistance`. Result reports `flippedOverlayCanvases` count. Verified against the DreamerUIDemos scene with 16 overlay canvases — all rendered correctly into one screenshot.
- **TextMeshPro rendering in `screenshot-prefab`** — `TextMeshProUGUI` and `TextMeshPro` text now renders. TMP has its own mesh-build pipeline that doesn't tick from `Canvas.ForceUpdateCanvases`; resolved via reflection on `TMPro.TMP_Text.ForceMeshUpdate()` in `SetupCanvasForPreview` (zero hard dependency on the TMP package — if not installed, the call is skipped silently). Verified with a hand-built prefab containing both `UnityEngine.UI.Text` and `TextMeshProUGUI` — both rendered.

### Added — `screenshot-prefab` (visual feedback for agents)
- **`./bin/dreamer screenshot-prefab --asset Assets/X.prefab [--width 512] [--height 512] [--angle iso|front|back|side|right|left|top|bottom] [--background-color "#RRGGBB[AA]"|JSON-rgba] [--transparent] [--save-to PATH]`** — renders a prefab to a PNG using Unity's `PreviewRenderUtility`. Camera auto-frames the prefab's combined mesh bounds (computed from `MeshFilter.sharedMesh.bounds` / `SkinnedMeshRenderer.localBounds` / `Sprite.bounds` and transformed to world-space, NOT from `Renderer.bounds` — the latter is uninitialized for objects in a PreviewScene that haven't rendered yet). Two-light rim setup, configurable background.
- **Custom `--background-color`** accepts hex (`#1a3a8a`, `#1a3a8a80`) or JSON RGB(A) array of 0..1 floats (`[1.0, 0.95, 0.7]`). Default neutral gray.
- **`--transparent` flag** — outputs PNG with full alpha channel (color type 6 / RGBA). Skips PreviewRenderUtility's `BeginStaticPreview`/`EndStaticPreview` (which uses an RGB-only internal RenderTexture and silently drops alpha) in favor of a custom ARGB32 RT bound to the preview camera, then `ReadPixels` into an RGBA32 Texture2D. PNGs are now always RGBA regardless of background opacity, so transparency is ready when you need it.
- Output goes to `Library/DreamerScreenshots/<stem>-<guid8>-<ticks>.png` by default (Library/ is gitignored). Override with `--save-to`.
- Result includes `path`, `boundsCenter`, `boundsSize`, `byteCount`. Open the PNG with the Read tool — Claude Code is multimodal, Read returns the image inline so the agent can see what it built.
- **UI/Canvas prefabs render** — auto-detected for three kinds: (1) prefab has a `Canvas` at root, (2) prefab has a `Canvas` descendant, (3) prefab is a fragment with uGUI components but no Canvas (list items, row entries, slot prefabs, etc). Result includes `mode: "ui"`, camera switches to orthographic, default angle becomes `front`. PreviewRenderUtility's preview scene doesn't tick the Canvas mesh-build pipeline, so UI mode parks the prefab off-screen in the active scene, runs `LayoutRebuilder.ForceRebuildLayoutImmediate` on every RectTransform, dirties every Graphic, then renders via a temporary camera.
- **Canvas-less fragments are now wrapped in a temporary WorldSpace Canvas** automatically. Verified against a real fragment (Button + LayoutElement + child Text): all rendered cleanly. Verified against a complex hand-built UI (TitleBar + Slider + Dropdown + Toggle + Buttons): all widgets render with proper layout.
- **`--size [w,h]` flag** to override the prefab's RectTransform `sizeDelta`. Layout-group-driven prefabs come back at zero or near-zero size when standalone; `--size` lets you force a sensible footprint. When unset: `LayoutElement.preferredWidth/Height` hints win, falling back to 400×100.
- Known limitations:
  - **TextMeshProUGUI text often invisible** — TMP has its own mesh-build pipeline that doesn't tick from `Canvas.ForceUpdateCanvases`. Standard `UnityEngine.UI.Text` works.
  - Logic-only prefabs (no MeshFilter/SkinnedMeshRenderer/SpriteRenderer/Canvas/RectTransform) come back as an empty gray frame; the `boundsSize: [1,1,1]` fallback is the tell.
  - Particles, trails, lines, lights, and post-processing don't contribute to bounds — camera frames static-mesh extent only.

### Fixed — `create-script --path` accepting a `.cs` file path
If `--path` ended in `.cs` (e.g. `Assets/Scripts/Foo/Bar.cs`), Dreamer treated the whole string as a folder, `mkdir`'d `Bar.cs/`, and wrote `Bar.cs/Bar.cs` inside it. Now: a `.cs`-suffixed `--path` is split into parent folder + class name. If `--name` is also given and disagrees with the filename, the command fails fast with a clear message instead of silently nesting.

### Added — PlayerSettings + Build Settings authoring
PlayerSettings fields that go through the static `UnityEditor.PlayerSettings` API (icons, per-platform identifiers, cursor) don't round-trip through the generic SerializedObject editor. Added wrappers:

- **`inspect-player-settings [--target standalone|android|ios|webgl|...]`** — common fields via static API: company/product/version, screen, color space, scripting backend, API compatibility, default cursor + hotspot, default icons, per-platform icons. Default target is `standalone`.
- **`set-app-id --target NAME --id com.foo.bar`** — per-platform application/bundle identifier (`PlayerSettings.SetApplicationIdentifier(NamedBuildTarget, string)`). Targets: standalone, android, ios, webgl, tvos, windowsstore, ps4, ps5, xboxone, switch.
- **`set-default-icon --texture Assets/path.png`** — Default Icon slot (`PlayerSettings.SetIcons(NamedBuildTarget.Unknown, [tex], IconKind.Application)`). Unity scales to all platforms.
- **`set-app-icons --target NAME --textures '[...]'`** — per-platform icon array. Result includes `expectedCount` so you can verify against Unity's required slot count for that target.
- **`set-cursor-icon --texture Assets/path.png [--hotspot [x,y]]`** — Default Cursor + click-point hotspot (`PlayerSettings.defaultCursor` / `cursorHotspot`).

EditorBuildSettings.scenes (the build-scenes list) similarly needs its own command surface — it's a `EditorBuildSettingsScene[]` setter, not a SerializedObject array:
- **`inspect-build-scenes`** — list `{index, path, enabled, guid}` for each scene in the list.
- **`set-build-scenes --scenes JSON`** — replace the whole list. Items are either string paths (enabled by default) or `{path, enabled}`. All scenes must exist on disk.
- **`add-build-scene --scene PATH [--enabled false]`** — append; updates the enabled flag in place if already present.
- **`remove-build-scene --scene PATH`** — remove by path.

For other PlayerSettings fields not yet wrapped (companyName, productName, bundleVersion, defaultScreenWidth, etc.), the existing generic command works: `set-project-setting --file ProjectSettings --property companyName --value '"AnttiCo"'` — the SerializedObject reaches them.

### Added — Project Settings authoring (full coverage)
ProjectSettings/*.asset files live outside Assets/, so the existing `set-property`/`inspect-asset` commands (which use `LoadAssetAtPath`) couldn't reach them. Two layers of new commands address this:

**Phase 1 — first-class wrappers for the common cases:**
- **`inspect-project-settings [--file NAME]`** — overview: 32 layers (with name/builtin flag), tags, sorting layers, 3D + 2D physics summary (gravity + disabled-collision pairs), and a list of every `.asset` in `ProjectSettings/`. With `--file X`: per-field listing for that one file.
- **`set-layer-name --index N --name X [--force]`**, **`clear-layer --index N [--force]`** — name a physics/rendering layer; builtin slots (0-7) require `--force`.
- **`add-tag --name X`**, **`remove-tag --name X`** — TagManager tags (uses `InternalEditorUtility.AddTag`/`RemoveTag`).
- **`add-sorting-layer --name X`**, **`remove-sorting-layer --name X`** — 2D sorting layers (Default is protected).
- **`set-layer-collision --layer-a A --layer-b B [--collide true|false] [--2d]`** — physics layer collision matrix (3D + 2D). Names or numeric indices accepted; matrix is symmetric.
- **`set-physics-gravity --value [x,y,z] [--2d]`** — global gravity. 3D = `Physics.gravity`, 2D = `Physics2D.gravity` (requires `--2d`).

**Phase 2 — generic SerializedObject editor for the long tail:**
- **`set-project-setting --file NAME --property PATH --value JSON`** — edit any field on any `ProjectSettings/*.asset` (PlayerSettings build target overrides, GraphicsSettings, TimeManager, AudioManager, QualitySettings, EditorSettings, …). Same value semantics as `set-property` (arrays, sparse `{_size, N: val}`, asset/scene refs, struct objects). Bracket shorthand `field[N]` is rewritten to `field.Array.data[N]`.
- **`inspect-project-setting --file NAME [--property PATH] [--depth N]`** — inspect a single file's full field listing or drill into a sub-tree.

Discovery flow: `inspect-project-settings` lists files → `inspect-project-setting --file X` lists fields on one → `set-project-setting --file X --property m_Y --value V` edits. No gate; project settings are normal authoring operations.

### Added — `set-play-mode` command + per-machine policy gate
- **`./bin/dreamer set-play-mode --state enter|exit|toggle|pause|unpause|toggle-pause`** — first-class play-mode control via `EditorApplication.EnterPlaymode()` / `ExitPlaymode()` / `isPaused`. Replaces the `execute-menu-item Edit/Play` workaround, which silently failed because Unity's `ExecuteMenuItem` returns false for menu items with validation handlers (Play and Pause among them).
- `execute-menu-item Edit/Play` and `execute-menu-item Edit/Pause` are now auto-routed to the new command on the bridge side, so existing agent code that targeted the menu paths keeps working.
- **Per-machine policy gate** — on first bridge start after this update, the developer is asked once via a Unity dialog whether agents may toggle play mode. Default ON. The choice is stored in EditorPrefs (`Dreamer.AllowPlayModeToggle`) and can be flipped at any time in `Tools > Dreamer` under "Agent Policy". When OFF, all agent attempts (including auto-routed Edit/Play) return a clear "disabled by the project owner" error so agents surface the issue rather than retrying.

### Added — AnimatorController authoring (Animation add-on)
- **`create-animator-controller --name X [--path FOLDER]`** — creates a new `.controller` asset with one default layer.
- **`add-animator-parameter --asset <.controller> --name X --type bool|int|float|trigger [--default V]`** — defines a parameter referenced by transition conditions. Names must be unique.
- **`add-animator-state --asset <.controller> --name X [--motion <.anim>] [--speed N] [--layer N]`** — adds a state with an optional `Motion` clip binding. First state on an empty layer auto-becomes default.
- **`add-animator-transition --asset <.controller> --from STATE --to STATE [--conditions JSON] [--has-exit-time true] [--exit-time N] [--duration N]`** — wires a transition. `--from AnyState` for AnyState transitions, `--to Exit` for exit transitions. Conditions: `{parameter, mode: If|IfNot|Greater|Less|Equals|NotEqual, threshold?}`. Multiple conditions = AND.
- **`set-animator-default-state --asset <.controller> --state X [--layer N]`** — overrides the layer's default state.
- **`inspect-animator-controller --asset <.controller>`** — full controller inspection: parameters, layers, states (with motion paths + speeds), transitions (with conditions).
- v1 scope is state-machine root only. Sub-state machines, blend trees, and per-layer masks are out of scope (author them in the Unity Animator window if needed). `Entry` is not supported as a transition source — use `set-animator-default-state` instead, which Unity treats as the implicit entry connection.

### Added — Sprite curves + Animation events (Animation add-on)
- **`set-sprite-curve --asset <.anim> [--target SUB] [--component TYPENAME] [--property NAME] --keys JSON`** — write/replace an ObjectReferenceCurve for sprite-swap animation. Defaults to `SpriteRenderer.m_Sprite`. Each key: `{ "time": N, "sprite": "path.png" }` or `{ "time": N, "sprite": {"assetRef": "path.png", "subAsset": "Walk_0"} }` for multi-sprite atlas slices.
- **`delete-sprite-curve --asset <.anim> [--target SUB] [--component TYPENAME] [--property NAME]`** — remove a sprite-swap curve.
- **`set-animation-events --asset <.anim> --events JSON`** — replace ALL events on a clip. Each: `{ time, functionName, stringParameter?, floatParameter?, intParameter?, objectReferenceParameter? }`. Pass `[]` to clear.
- `inspect-animation-clip` now also returns `events[]` and per-key sprite info on object-reference bindings.

### Added — Animation add-on (`com.dreamer.agent-bridge.animation`)
- New optional package alongside `com.dreamer.agent-bridge.ugui`. Five new commands for AnimationClip authoring (AnimatorController state-machine commands forthcoming).
- **`create-animation-clip --name X [--path FOLDER] [--frame-rate N] [--loop true|false]`** — creates a new `.anim` asset with the given frameRate (default 30) and loop setting.
- **`set-animation-curve --asset <.anim> [--target SUB] --component <FQN> --property <m_Field.x> --keys '[{...}]'`** — write or replace one float-curve binding. `--target` is relative to the animated GO root (empty = root). Each key: `{ t, v, interp?, inTangent?, outTangent?, inWeight?, outWeight? }`. Supported `interp` modes: `linear`, `constant`, `auto`, `clamped`, `free` (free = use explicit tangent values).
- **`inspect-animation-clip --asset <.anim>`** — list all curve bindings with per-curve summary (keyCount, time/value range). Object-reference bindings are listed but not editable in v1.
- **`sample-animation-curve --asset <.anim> [--target SUB] --component <FQN> --property <m_Field.x> [--samples 30] [--t-start N] [--t-end N]`** — evaluate one curve at N evenly-spaced times and return `[{t, v}, ...]`. **The agent's primary tool for verifying curves numerically** — read back after every set-animation-curve to catch tangent surprises and overshoot.
- **`delete-animation-curve --asset <.anim> [--target SUB] --component <FQN> --property <m_Field.x>`** — remove one binding by triple.
- Add-on plugin discovery: same reflection-based pattern as the ugui add-on. If the package isn't installed, dispatcher returns "Unknown command kind" and the schema docs hint at the install command.

### Added — `set-particle-property` command
- New first-class command: `./bin/dreamer set-particle-property (--scene-object PATH | --asset PATH [--child-path SUB]) --property MODULE.FIELD --value JSON`. Reaches ParticleSystem module fields (`main.startLifetime`, `emission.rateOverTime`, `shape.angle`, `noise.strength`, etc.) that the generic `set-property` couldn't touch — modules are exposed via wrapper-struct property accessors, not direct serialized fields, and the underlying serialized names also don't match the API (`main` → `InitialModule`, `limitVelocityOverLifetime` → `ClampVelocityModule`, `textureSheetAnimation` → `UVModule`, …). The handler does the API-name → serialized-name rewrite for the 23 known modules.
- MinMaxCurve scalar shorthand: a bare number (`--value 5`) auto-sets `scalar` + `minScalar` + `minMaxState=Constant`. `{"min":N,"max":M}` sets TwoConstants mode. For curve-mode (animated over particle lifetime), drill into sub-fields explicitly: `main.startLifetime.scalar`, `.minMaxState`, `.maxCurve`.

### Added — `./bin/dreamer update` now lists what changed
- `./bin/dreamer update` diffs `CHANGELOG.md` between the previous and new install and emits `changelog.newEntries[]` in the result JSON. The dreamer skill instructs Claude to read those entries to the user after a successful update — no more "the update worked" without knowing what changed.
- `CHANGELOG.md` is now copied as part of `update`, so installs stay in sync with upstream changelogs.
- `update` now copies the entire `.claude/skills/dreamer/` directory (was: only `SKILL.md`), so companion files like `tasks.md`, `property-values.md`, `materials-shaders.md` also stay current.

### Added — inspect overhaul + read-property (2026-04-25, `2da53da`)
- **`inspect-many --paths a,b,c`** — bulk-inspect N assets in one round-trip. Returns `{count, succeeded, failed, items[]}` in input order; per-item failures become `{path, error}` instead of aborting the batch.
- **`read-property`** — inverse of `set-property`. Same target args (`--asset` / `--scene-object` / `--child-path` / `--component`), returns the property value as JSON. Vectors as `{x,y,z[,w]}`, colors as `{r,g,b,a}`, ObjectReference as `{name, type, assetPath, instanceId}`. No more YAML parsing for field reads.
- **`--include-transforms`** on `inspect` / `inspect-hierarchy` / `inspect-many` — every node gets `transform: {localPosition, localEulerAngles, localScale}`.
- **`--include-fields`** on the same commands — every component gets a `fields[]` array with serialized values (primitives, vectors, colors, refs). Heavier payload — opt-in.
- **`--depth N`** on inspect commands — cap recursion. Default `-1` = unlimited; `0` = root only.
- **`inspect-hierarchy --asset PREFAB.prefab`** — dump a prefab's full hierarchy via AssetDatabase. Was scene-only — agents had to fall back to YAML parsing for prefab structure.
- **`execute-method --args '<JSON-array>'`** — pass arguments to the static method. Type-coerced against the resolved overload (`long → int`, `double → float`, enum names, primitive arrays). Escape hatch is now usable for tasks that need scratch logic.
- **`help` accepts both kinds and CLI verbs** — `./bin/dreamer help inspect-many` now resolves (was: only `help inspect_assets` worked).

### Changed — inspect shape (2026-04-25, `2da53da`)
- `inspect` recurses ALL children by default. Was 1 level deep — deeper nodes only showed `childCount`.
- `inspect_asset` and `inspect_hierarchy` now produce IDENTICAL node shape — `{type, fullType, enabled}` per component, same across root and children. Previously root used `{type, name}` and children used bare strings.
- Every node exposes `instanceId, active, tag, layer, isStatic, childCount` (asset side previously only had components + 1-level children).

### Fixed (2026-04-25, `2da53da`)
- Schema validator recognizes the `integer` type (was: every schema field declared `integer` errored at validation time).
- `save-assets` now also saves dirty open scenes via `EditorSceneManager.SaveOpenScenes`. Previously scene-object mutations stayed in-memory after a "successful" save-assets call — `git diff` showed nothing.

### Added — scene/prefab editing (2026-04-19 → 2026-04-21)
- **`reparent` command** (`677c883`) — works in both scenes (`--scene-object`) and prefabs (`--asset --child-path`). Flags: `--new-parent`, `--keep-world-space`, `--sibling-index`. Cycle guard refuses self-/descendant-parenting with a chain in the error.
- **`set-property` rejects `m_Name` with a directive** (`6e90f88`) — points the caller at `rename` instead of returning a cryptic "Property not found on Component".

### Added — documentation surface (2026-04-19 → 2026-04-25)
- **All 38 command kinds have structured schemas** (`7c9dc3a`) — `./bin/dreamer help <kind>` returns args, examples, pitfalls, result shape.
- **`help conventions`** — cross-cutting rules (target forms `--asset` / `--scene-object` / `--child-path`, value formats for refs / sub-assets / sparse arrays, play-mode gating, multi-agent rules, forbidden patterns) factored out so per-kind schemas don't repeat them.
- **Per-schema `pitfalls[]` arrays** (`111390b`) — anti-patterns and "wrong → right" pairs surface inline next to the args.
- **`unity-scene-builder` subagent** (`677c883`) — translates scene descriptions to a sequence of Dreamer CLI calls.
- **`tasks.md` task→command index** (`111390b`) — flat lookup table for common workflows in the dreamer skill.

### Added — uGUI add-on (optional, shipped as `com.dreamer.agent-bridge.ugui`)
- **Separate Unity package** with its own asmdef, auto-registered into core
  via a reflection-based plugin hook in `CommandDispatcher`. Core Dreamer
  compiles and runs identically whether or not the add-on is installed.
- **Three public commands** — the entire UI-building surface:
  - `create-ui-tree --json JSON_OR_@file` — declarative tree builder.
    Modes: `create` / `append` / `replace-children` / `replace-self`.
    Starts at any level of the hierarchy, not just Canvas roots — agents
    can rebuild one panel without touching the surrounding UI. Node types:
    Panel, Image, Text, Button, VStack, HStack, Grid, ScrollList, Slider,
    Toggle, InputField, Spacer, Raw (escape hatch for custom
    MonoBehaviours).
  - `inspect-ui-tree --target PATH [--depth N]` — round-trip inspector.
    Dumps an existing UI subtree to the same schema the builder consumes.
    Recognized widgets get their type; unrecognized GOs become `Raw` with
    `components[]` preserved. Enables the read-edit-rebuild workflow.
  - `set-rect-transform (--scene-object PATH | --asset PATH) [--anchor
    PRESET] [--size WxH] [--pivot X,Y]` — one-call anchor/size/pivot
    configuration with 16 named presets (`center`, `top-stretch`, `fill`,
    etc.) instead of six brittle `set-property` calls.
- **`./bin/dreamer addon` subcommand** — `list` / `install <name>` /
  `remove <name>`. Installed add-ons are recorded in
  `daemon/.dreamer-source.json`'s `addons[]` field; `./bin/dreamer update`
  honors that list and refreshes them alongside core.
- **Separate skill file** at `.claude/skills/dreamer-ugui/SKILL.md` with a
  companion `schema.md` reference. Auto-loads only when the agent
  encounters UI-flavored task language (Canvas, Button, HUD, menu, etc.),
  so core Dreamer sessions pay no context cost for UI docs.
- **Design principle**: the UI scaffold Claude builds is intentionally
  legible-not-perfect — the user refines visually in Unity's Scene/Game
  view afterward. Claude's job is correct hierarchy + anchoring; Unity's
  job is pixel polish.

### Added — core
- **Material + shader commands** — closes a gap where materials couldn't
  be created or meaningfully edited via Dreamer (the generic set-property
  path didn't reach Unity's `MaterialProperty` API). Six new commands:
  - `create-material --name X [--path FOLDER] [--shader "Shader/Name"]` —
    creates a new `.mat` asset, falls back to Standard/URP-Lit/HDRP-Lit
    when `--shader` omitted (warning in result JSON).
  - `inspect-material --asset X.mat` — returns shader + full property
    list (name, display name, type, current value, range for Range props)
    + active keywords + render queue.
  - `set-material-property --asset X.mat --property _BaseColor --value
    '{"r":1,...}'` — routes by shader-declared property type to the right
    MaterialProperty setter. Color / Vector / Float / Int / Range / Texture
    values supported. Keyword form: `--keyword _EMISSION --enable true`.
  - `set-material-shader --asset X.mat --shader "Name"` — reassigns shader
    (Unity preserves compatible property values).
  - `shader-status [--asset X.shader]` — wraps `ShaderUtil.GetShaderMessages`.
    No-arg form scans every user shader under Assets/. Returns
    `status: ok|warnings|errors` plus per-message severity/text/file/line.
  - `inspect-shader (--asset X.shader | --shader "Name")` — declared
    property list + keywords + render queue + maximum LOD + any existing
    compile messages.
  Writing shader source is the same as writing .cs: direct file write +
  `refresh-assets`. There is no `create-shader` command — templates vary
  too much per render pipeline to be useful from Dreamer.
- **Play Mode gate for scene-edit commands.** Scene mutations made during
  Play Mode silently revert on exit (Unity's design — only EditMode edits
  persist). Dreamer now holds such commands in `waiting` with reason
  *"Play Mode active — scene edits would be lost on exit. Stop Play Mode
  in Unity (or submit with --allow-playmode to override)."* Gated kinds:
  `create_gameobject`, `instantiate_prefab`, `create_hierarchy` (scene
  mode, no `savePath`), and any `add_component` / `remove_component` /
  `set_property` / `delete_gameobject` / `rename_gameobject` /
  `duplicate` / `remove_missing_scripts` targeting a scene object. Asset
  targets, script writes, and read-only commands are not gated. Override
  flag: `--allow-playmode` on the CLI (serialized as
  `options.allowPlayMode` in the API).
- **`./bin/dreamer activity`** — newest-first view of recent commands across
  the queue, with per-entry label / kind / state / age / duration. Built for
  multi-agent visibility: when several Claude sessions drive the same
  project, each agent can call `activity --since 2m` before drawing
  conclusions about compile errors or scene state. Flags: `--limit N`,
  `--since 90s|5m|1h`, `--state X`. Exposed at `GET /api/activity`.
- **`--label TEXT` flag promoted as a first-class tool** in CLI help +
  SKILL.md. The flag already existed (as `humanLabel`); it's now documented
  as the canonical way to tag commands in parallel-agent scenarios, e.g.
  `--label "sessionA:player-setup"`. Labels appear in `status`, `queue`,
  and `activity` output.
- **SKILL.md "Parallel agent sessions" section** — tool-focused guidance,
  no prescriptive coordination protocol. Core rule: check
  `activity --since 2m` before blaming yourself for compile errors in
  multi-agent workflows.
- **`refresh-assets` auto-heal for "Unknown type" script misclassification.**
  Unity sometimes imports a `.cs` file via `DefaultImporter` (unknown asset
  type) instead of `MonoImporter` when the write lands while the Editor is
  unfocused on Windows. The MonoScript subasset never gets generated, so
  `add-component` fails and the script can't be dragged onto a GameObject.
  The daemon-side asset watcher now tracks which `.cs` files changed since
  the last refresh, and `refresh-assets` force-reimports any file Unity
  didn't classify as MonoScript. Result JSON includes `reimported[]` and
  `misclassified[]`.
- **`reimport-script` rescue command** — force-reimports `.cs` files under a
  path (file or folder, recursive by default), then kicks
  `CompilationPipeline.RequestScriptCompilation()`. Use when the auto-heal
  in `refresh-assets` didn't catch a misclassified file, or when the watcher
  missed the original write.
- **`set-property` property-name aliasing for built-in components** —
  Unity built-ins serialize as `m_Pascal` (e.g. `m_Sprite`, `m_LocalPosition`).
  The CLI now accepts the C# camelCase form (`sprite`, `localPosition`,
  `color`, `isTrigger`) and falls back to `m_<Cap>` on lookup failure. The
  result JSON includes `resolvedPath` so callers see which form Unity used.
  User-defined `[SerializeField]` fields keep their declared name unchanged.
- **`create-hierarchy` now surfaces component warnings instead of dropping
  silently.** Unknown types, not-a-Component types, and duplicates get
  recorded into a `warnings[]` array in the result JSON with the node path
  and reason.
- **`compile-status` summary shows age next to timestamps.**
  `Last observed clean compile: 2026-04-19T14:22:11Z (3m 14s ago).`

### Fixed
- **`set-property` on sprite sub-asset references** (SpriteRenderer.m_Sprite
  and similar) no longer silently no-ops. Previously, `assetRef` pointing at
  a Texture2D resolved to the main Texture asset and Unity silently dropped
  the cross-type assignment, leaving `m_Sprite: {fileID: 0}`. The object-ref
  resolver now:
  - Accepts an explicit `"subAsset": "name"` modifier to pick a named
    sub-asset (required for Multiple-mode sprite atlases).
  - When the field type can't be resolved via reflection (common for Unity
    built-in component fields), probes the main asset + each sub-asset
    against the SerializedProperty and auto-picks the one Unity accepts.
  - When multiple sub-assets match, returns an error listing candidates
    so the caller can disambiguate with `subAsset` — no more silent wrong
    assignment.
- **Prefab-editing commands no longer overwrite a successful outcome with
  a UnloadPrefabContents cleanup error.** `PrefabUtility.SaveAsPrefabAsset`
  sometimes disposes the internal scene backing the prefabRoot, so the
  subsequent `PrefabUtility.UnloadPrefabContents` throws "Specified object
  is not part of Prefab contents" — despite the save having already
  landed. Previously this threw the command into `failed` state even
  though the prefab asset was correct on disk. Now every Op that loads
  prefab contents uses `PrefabOps.SafeUnloadPrefabContents`, which
  swallows the cleanup error (the mutation is already persisted) and logs
  a diagnostic. Fixes the reported `add-component --asset` "error but
  component was actually applied" pattern.
- **`lastCompileSuccess` now updates on every compile**, not just the first
  one after daemon startup. The previous logic had two guards that both
  missed the common case: the bridge-restore path only ran when the value
  was null, and the edge-detection path required the daemon to observe
  `compiling: true → false` directly (short compiles finish between state
  ticks, so the edge was never registered). Bridge timestamp is now
  accepted monotonically — whenever newer than the current record. Fixes
  the "force-compile, check timestamp, retry" agent loop where
  `compile-status` reported an old timestamp despite Unity having
  re-compiled.

### Changed
- **Dreamer CLI reference moved from slash command to Claude Code skill.**
  The reference now lives at `.claude/skills/dreamer/SKILL.md` (auto-loaded
  by Claude when Unity work appears) instead of `.claude/commands/dreamer.md`
  (user-invoked only via `/dreamer`). `./bin/dreamer update` migrates
  pre-existing installs — it removes the legacy file after copying the new
  skill. Fresh installs write only the skill.
- **SKILL.md prioritizes the synthesized `compile-status` fields.** New
  section at the top of the compile-status docs tells agents to read
  `body.status` + `summary` as source of truth rather than computing
  verdicts from raw `errors` / `lastSuccess` / `compiling` fields, plus a
  stop-retrying rule after two failed refresh-assets cycles. Mitigates the
  agent-loop pattern reported in Blackend Core use.
